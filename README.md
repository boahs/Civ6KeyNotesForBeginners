# Key notes for general and early CIV 6 game: 


1. trading locally within your cities is 99% of the time better than going for the largest gold yield. When you trade locally roads are built for free by your traders and also depending on the districts (science, production, culture) the trader will trade these between cities along with the gold being made. Roads + Research + Gold

2. fresh water is +3 housing(dark green)
   coaster water is +1 housing(light green) 

3. use club fighters on turn 1 before settler to get more line of sight on starting area

4. you can hold shift + click to queue specific research , pref going whatever tileset you land on and going into archers for the early barbarians

5. more science will make science research faster

6. more culture will make culture research faster 

7. When half way leveled into a technology you can start another and go trigger a boost to finish the second half of the skill you stopped half way through completing it.

8. focusing on science / military / gold is all the players choice after your initial army is built to hold off barbarians

9. political philosphy is great to go for early in the civics tree

10. get as many boosts and inspirations you can early

11. luxury techs , military techs for science

12. bigger government for civics  (pol philosphsy)

13. production is key for winning games - it's very important 

14. First city grows way faster than the new cities right away so you can get away with getting an early holy sight or   or encampment. Getting NEW cities to pop 7+ will be best with indrustral hub      o    or commercial hub, then you can add campus. Also if you can build harber and commercial hub it's a double win.
    Sometimes shit changes and you're forced to go into heavy military. 

15. How do we best place districts to get the most out of them? 
    aerodome / space port - require population to build them
    aquaduct - if you didnt settle on fresh water or salt then you should try to build aqueduct. they do not count towards district limit in city. 

16. campus you want the biggest adjacency bonus possible. All districts can count to give this bonus along with tiles. Near MOUNTAIN / RAINFOREST / OTHER DISTRCTS is the best typically 

17. commercial hub +2 gold from adjacent river or harbor is the easiest bonus to get with this you do need a harbor to get this bonus going obviously

18. encampment - towards areas you typically want to project ... units will spawn on these 

19. entertainment - low value tiles always...and flat. Be careful when placing both zoo and stadium these will have their bonus stretched to 6 tiles around. Adjacent bonus doesn't matter too much for this.

20. Indrustrial zone - primary production, adjacency bonus easiest to get from mine or quarie. Placing on flatland surrounded by hills Careful when placing power plants because where the bonus stretches 6 tiles they do not stack

21. holy sight - not too important , maybe one or two is good to get some faith but not too big of a concern

22. neighborhoods - does not matter go for housing 4 or 5 is great 6 is gg

23. harbors - don't worry too much about maximum yield. Try to build near commerce hub t o gain adjaceny bonus or any district. but commercial hub should be closest.

24. theatre square - wherever dont take good tiles with these. culture IS valueable but these typically arent great

25. unique districts do not count towards limit cap for districts - place ASAP if your civ has one
